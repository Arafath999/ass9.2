# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




*  Firebase Authentication Integration:Get auth

It imports Firebase Authentication methods and initializes Firebase with the app configuration.
It sets up a getAuth instance to interact with Firebase Authentication.

+ Authentication State Management:UseState of loading

The component manages the user's authentication state using the useState hook. The user state variable holds the current authenticated user, and the loading state variable is used to track loading states.


- useEffect for Authentication State Changes:

It uses the useEffect hook to listen for changes in the user's authentication state using onAuthStateChanged. When the authentication state changes, it updates the user state variable accordingly.


+ Import Dependencies:

It imports necessary dependencies from React, including useContext for accessing the authentication context and useLocation for obtaining the current location.


* Access Authentication Context:

It uses the useContext hook to access the authentication context (AuthContext) created earlier. This allows the component to retrieve information about the authenticated user and the loading state.
